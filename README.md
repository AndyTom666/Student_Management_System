# Student_Management_System
An SSM framework project that manages student informationï¼Œ
The system uses SSM framework for back-end developement and HTML/CSS and AJAX as front-end technolgy, uses MYSQL as database system.
I was responsible for the design and implementation of the database, supporting the backend operations for adding, deleting, modifying, 
and querying student information. Throughout the system's deployment and development, I thoroughly mastered technologies related to 
frontend-backend interaction and database connectivity.
